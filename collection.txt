      How to solve problems
      While there is problem, there is programming. 
      Computer is born to solve problem. But it is as stupid as they always be. Computer only can do what we people tell it to do. Actually, people have to know how to solve the problem by ourselves.
      Some tasks are easy to put, like print "Hello World" or calculate sum of 13 and 7. These probably are not a problem. When it is coming to the real problems which are not so easy to figure out, these rules could be applied:
      
        Don't panic
        What are the inputs?
        What are the outputs?
        Work through some examples by hand.
        Simple mechanical solution.
        Develop incrementally and test as we go.
      
    
    
      Frequently found coding errors
      Here are some errors always found in a python script:
      
        missing colon
        In such cases the colon might be missing:
          
            def functionName():
            if/else statement
            for/while loops
          
        
        equal sign
        When compare two values, mostly in if statement, the equal sign == is often misused as assignment = . 
        return statement
        Although not all functions need return something, it is important to remember the return statement where the output date need to be given out to other functions.
        variable called before value assignment
        In python, a variable must be assigned to a value before it would be called or used. Otherwise python interpreter would stop the program and cast an error as: name *** is not defined. Here *** stands for the variable name you'd like to refer to.
